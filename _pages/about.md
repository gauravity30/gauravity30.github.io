Namaste! I’m a Scientist/Engineer at ISRO, with a deep interest in fluid mechanics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). I enjoy working at the intersection of engineering and biology, with a particular focus on avian flight.

Previously, I worked on bioinspired aerodynamics and hydrodynamic stability under the guidance of <a href='https://www.iist.ac.in/aerospace/manukv'>Dr. Manu K V</a> and <a href='https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/AE/faculty/ae-ssaha'>Dr. Sandeep Saha</a>. My undergraduate research involved studying the aerodynamics of the Common Swift’s tail using high-fidelity CFD and exploring the complex flow structures around it. I also studied the hydrodynamic stability of flow over the Eppler 387 airfoil.

I hold a B.Tech in Aerospace Engineering from <a href='https://www.iist.ac.in/'>IIST, Thiruvananthapuram</a>. My experience spans bioinspired aerodynamics and CFD, with additional background in flight dynamics, aircraft design, and high-performance computing. 

I like fighter aircrafts and animals. Best way to reach me is through <a href='mailto:gauravg.aero@gmail.com'>email</a>.
